		POrtable RunTime System (PORTS)

The PORTS group was established to address the problems of
constructing a common runtime system to be used as a compiler target
for various task and data parallel languages.  Towards this end, a
charter for the group has been established, with to goals of
  * identify opportunities for code sharing among projects, 
  * focusing on task and data parallel languages, and 
  * designing and implementing a common runtme system which
    supports task and data parallel languages and interoperability.

More information about the PORTS effort and its participants can be

Argonne/Caltech PORTS0 Implementation
-------------------------------------

This is the Argonne/Caltech implementation of the PORTS level 0
interface.  It currently supports the following systems:

  * IBM RS/6000 AIX 3.2.5 with DCE threads
  * HP/UX 9.x with DCE threads
  * SunOS 4.1.3 using FSU pthreads and GNU compiler
  * Sun Solaris 2.3
  * NEXTSTEP 3.x

If you have problems with or questions about this implementation, 
please send email to:

	ports-support@mcs.anl.gov


Building PORTS0
---------------

To build the PORTS0 library, for example, for the IBM do:
	ln -s makefile.ibm makefile
	make

There is a simple test program in test.c.  To build it, run:
	make test
