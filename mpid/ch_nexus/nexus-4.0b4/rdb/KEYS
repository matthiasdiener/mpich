This is the "official" set of common keys that may be in a resource
database.

I am obviously not suggesting that all systems must implement all
features represented by keys, or that they are restricted to only this
set of keys.  I'm just suggesting that if a system needs a key for one
of these purposes, then it should use the standard key name.  That way
it can share common resource databases with other systems.

ss_port		Port to the secure server
ss_type         Variant of secure server.
ss_login	Login name to use with the secure server
ss_token	IWAY login token for the IWAY secure server.
ss_listener     Path to listener

rsh_login	Login name to use with rsh

domain		The domain suffix to add to this hostname.(i.e. ".mcs.anl.gov")
tcp_interface	The TCP interface name to use when
			connecting to this resource.
udp_interface	The UDP interface name to use when
			connecting to this resource.
mn_udp_interface The Myranet UDP interface name to use when 
			connecting to this resource.
atm_interface	The ATM interface name to use when
			connecting to this resource.

startup_exe	The name of the executable program to use
			when starting on this resource.
startup_dir	The directory from which the startup-exe
			should be run.

protocols	An ordered, comma separated list of protocols
			that can be used to talk to the resource.
			The list may contain:
				tcp
				atm
				others specific to the various systems
startups	An ordered, comma separated list of the
			startup methods that can be used to start
			processes on this resource.
			The list may contain:
				rsh
				ss	(secure server)
				fork
				others specific to the various systems

st_rsh_username Altername username to use for rsh.

Protocol specific keys:
startup_type	The type of startup to perform for this node/partition.
			The valid values are:
				mpl
				network
				paragon
			mpl starts an IBM SP MPL program using poe.
			network starts a list of nodes as a group.
			paragon is not yet implemented.
startup_count	Number of nodes (integer) that startup_type= will start.
startup_mpl_hostname
		If startup_type=mpl, this specifies the machine to 
			which an rsh or ss startup should be
			run in order to execute the poe command.
startup_mpl_hostfile
		If startup_type=mpl, this specifies the MP_HOSTFILE to use.
startup_paragon_hostname
		If startup_type=paragon, this specifies the machine to 
			which an rsh or ss startup should be
			run in order to execute the poe command.
startup_paragon_pn
		If startup_type=mpl, this specifies the argument for
			the -pn flag to use when starting the application
			on the Paragon.
			If not specified, then "open" is used.
startup_network_nodes
		If startup_type=network, this specifies a colon separated
			node list (i.e. the same as is passed to
			the -nodes argument), of the nodes that should
			be started as part of this group.
