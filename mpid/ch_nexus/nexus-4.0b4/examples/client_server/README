These examples were hacked together one afternoon with the CAVE2CAVE
developers, as a starting point for their client/server based system.
It shows how to use nexus attachment to write client/server programs.

broker.c is a simple nexus server.

bcontrol.c is a simple nexus client, which can connect to the broker
and make requests to it.

You can also drop test.c into this directory from the Nexus distribution,
and build it using this makefile.

The makefile is setup to allow it to easily be changed to compile 
for SunOS4, SGI, and IBM AIX.
