This is a multi-protocol device that uses the Nexus run-time system
communication primitives.  See
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/people/geisler/projects/mpi.html for more
information.

When you compile a program using this program, be sure to include the
nexus header files and to link with the nexus library.

An experimental version that uses threads is under way.  You can add an
EXPERIMENTAL define to the make of this device to try it out.  It is
not supported, but please send bugs/fixes/suggestions to me at
geisler@mcs.anl.gov.
