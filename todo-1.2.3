This file is to record things that need to be done before releasing 1.2.3

Highly tentative beginning of final tests for 1.2.3 release:  Friday, January 11.

Add things below this line when it is decided that we need to fix them before
the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do:

p4 device:
     Nothing pending
	
MPD:
     check for buffer overrun at least in setting up mpdmpexec message from
       console to mpd, and in other dangerous places (dangerous = loop over
       args)
     test totalview interface
	
MPE:
     check recent bug report on clog.


MPICH-G2:
    - get mpich-g2 to work with mpich-based vMPI's at least with globus v2.0
      and if possible globus v1.1.4
    - update g2 portion of mpich doc.  this should include new installation
      instructions for globus v2.0
    - integrate sc01 mods 
    - talk to joe link about the mods he feels are necessary, 
      make those changes where appropriate
    - add checks to of return codes from calls to globus functions
    - when all done, run test suite in following situations 
      on number of platforms:
	- globus v1.1.4; with and without mpich-based vMPI
	- globus v2.0; with and without mpich-based vMPI

Move things below this line when done.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:

MPD:
     fix manual for -MPDLOC- and -MPDENV- options on mpirun
	Discuss squash format for multiple nodes, both in machinefile and args
     enable setting of working directory on mpirun command line
     add set working directory option and replace current incorrect stuff in 
       manual  (ch_p4mpd manual has ch_p4 working directory info)
     get mpd crash recovery back into stable state.
     provide better, user-oriented message for missing .mpdpasswd or .mpd.conf file
	or wrong permissions on said file
     add command-line option to store job id in file
     make running with -np 0 an error (currently hangs)

     make sure mpichboot works as described in the manual
       It doesn't.  Manual needs to be changed to describe startdaemons
       instead, and startdaemons needs to be added to install (It gets built
       in mpich/bin)   
       -> manual changed and changes tested under Linux

     check whether .mpdpasswd only still works or .mpd.conf is now required
       -> .mpd.conf is required.  Manual changed to eliminate mention
       of .mpdpasswd.  

p4 device with comm=shared:  Wycoff patch

p4 device:
     look into rash of "can't do xdr sends" reports.  Report is that 
       configure does find xdr but apparently compile var isn't set.  Test.
       See recent mpi-bugs on HAVE_XDR and HAS_XDR.	Tests in p4 code are
       for CAN_DO_XDR. (Done, was HAVE_XDR where HAS_XDR needed).  Added
       additional tests to release test; unfortunately, uncovered another
       bug.

     look at patch supplied with req 6500 (fortran compile flags -i8 -r8 )
     --> applied; it adds long long and long double to known types.

     test totalview interface
     --> works (message queue display)

MPE
     test jumpshot and mpe

Move things below this line instead, when it has been decided to postpone them
to 1.2.4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do eventually:

p4 device:
     Heterogeneous tests fail sendrecv4 (but pass sendrecv, sendrecv2, and
	sendrecv3!).  Currently, the test for sendrecv4 is turned off in
       /home/MPI/maint/build/testhetero, but it should be re-enabled once
       1.2.3 is released.
