*** TODO List: ******************************
Status: Non-XDR handling is done. 
	(for contiguous datatypes)
	Partial work on XDR code is done.

Add checking communicator heterogeneity
and decoding in receive completion

Need a way to change size sent to device
(in send case) and returned to user
(in recv case) for XDR.

Fix to handle heterogeneous case:
  MPIR_Pack_Hvector
  DMPI_get_from_contig
  DMPI_put_from_contig

Fix bug in:
  DMPI_get_from_contig (maxlen = -1)
  (If DMPI_get_from_contig is fixed and
   MPID_PACK_IN_ADVANCE and RETURN_PACKED
   is disabled (and a minor change or two
   made in MPIR_Send_setup), non-contiguous,
   non-packed messages may work...)
