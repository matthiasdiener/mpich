.TP
.B newcomm 
- new communicator (handle) 
.PD 1

.SH ALGORITHM

The current algorithm used has quite a few (read: a lot of) inefficiencies
.SH THAT CAN BE REMOVED.  HERE'S WHAT WE DO FOR NOW
.br
1) A table is built of colors, and keys (has a next field also).
.br
2) The tables of all processes are merged using MPI_Allreduce
.br
3) Two contexts are allocated for all the comms to be created.  These
same two contexts can be used for all created communicators since
the communicators will not overlap.
.br
4) If the local process has a color of MPI_UNDEFINED, it can return
a NULL comm.
.br
5) The table entries that match the local process color are sorted 
by key/rank.
.br
6) A group is created from the sorted list and a communicator is created
with this group and the previously allocated contexts.
