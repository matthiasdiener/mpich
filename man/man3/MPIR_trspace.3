.SH NAME
MPIR_trspace \-  Routines for tracing space usage 
.SH DESCRIPTION
MPIR_trmalloc replaces malloc and MPIR_trfree replaces free.
These routines
have the same syntax and semantics as the routines that they replace,
In addition, there are routines to report statistics on the memory
usage, and to report the currently allocated space.  These routines
are built on top of malloc and free, and can be used together with
them as long as any space allocated with MPIR_trmalloc is only freed with
MPIR_trfree.
