.SH NOTES
This send is provided as a convenience function; it allows the user to
send messages without worring about where they are buffered (because the
user `must` have provided buffer space with MPI_Buffer_attach).

The buffer space can not be reused unless you are certain that the message
has been received (not just that it should have been received).  In C, you can
force the messages to be deliverd by
.nf
    MPI_Buffer_detach( &b, &n );
    MPI_Buffer_attach( b, n );
.fi

(The 'MPI_Buffer_detach' will not complete until all buffered messages are
delivered.)
