.SH NAME
MPI_Bsend \- Basic send with user-specified buffering

.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.PD 0
.TP
.B buf 
- initial address of send buffer (choice) 
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B count 
- number of elements in send buffer (nonnegative integer) 
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B datatype 
- datatype of each send buffer element (handle) 
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B dest 
- rank of destination (integer) 
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B tag 
- message tag (integer) 
.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B comm 
- communicator (handle) 
.PD 1

.SH NOTES
This send is provided as a convenience function; it allows the user to
send messages without worring about where they are buffered (because the
user 
.B must
have provided buffer space with 
.I MPI_Buffer_attach
).

The buffer space can not be reused unless you are certain that the message
has been received (not just that it should have been received).  In C, you can
force the messages to be delivered by
.nf
    MPI_Buffer_detach( &b, &n );
    MPI_Buffer_attach( b, n );
.fi

(The 
.I MPI_Buffer_detach
will not complete until all buffered messages are
delivered.)

.SH NOTES FOR FORTRAN
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for 
.I MPI_WTIME
and 
.I MPI_WTICK
) have
an additional argument 
.I ierr
at the end of the argument list.  
.I ierr
is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
.I call
statement.

All MPI objects (e.g., 
.I MPI_Datatype
, 
.I MPI_Comm
) are of type 
.I INTEGER
in Fortran.
