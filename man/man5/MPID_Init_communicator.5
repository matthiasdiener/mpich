int MPID_Init_communicator( void * ctx, MPI_Comm comm )
.fi

.SH NOTES
Not yet used.

This interface is intended to let the ADI optimize for various collective
operations by detecting whether special features are available.
Note that 
.I MPI_Pack
 is a collective operation in the sense that the
result must be valid for all members of a communicator; by letting the
ADI initialize a communicator, it can pre-determine if, for example,
all members use the same data-representation.

For future extensions for collective operations and shared-memory
systems, this entry could allocate data-structures for performing
various operations.
