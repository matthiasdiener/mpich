.TH MPID_IS_HETERO 5 "10/10/1994" " " "ADI"
.SH NAME
MPID_IS_HETERO \- Indicates that heterogeneous processors are present

.SH NOTES
This is a global variable that can be used to determine if an ADI
that could contain heterogeneous processors actually does.  For example,
if the ADI can connect disimilar workstations but the active collection
contains only similar workstations, then MPID_HAS_HETERO would be
defined, but MPID_IS_HETERO would be false.
