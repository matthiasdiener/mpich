.TH MPID_Test_request 5 "8/23/1995" " " "ADI"
.SH NAME
MPID_Test_request \- Tests a request for completion.

.SH INPUT PARAMETER
.PD 0
.TP
.B ctx 
- ADI context returned by 
.I MPID_Init

.PD 1
.PD 0
.TP
.B request 
- MPI_Request handle to test.
.PD 1

.SH RETURN VALUE
True (!= 0) if the request has completed, False (0) otherwise.

.SH NOTES
This routine must return true if the request either has completed
or would complete if 
.I MPID_Check_device
 were called.  In other words,
it must be possible to have a loop
.nf
       while (!MPID_Test_request( ctx, request )) ;
.fi

that will terminate when the message has been sent or received, without
requiring an explicit call to another ADI routine.
