.SH NAME
MPID_Message_protocol \- Describes the message prototcol used by the
Chameleon ADI

.SH NOTES
All messages are sent with a short header message.  In addition,
long messages may be sent separately, in-order to make best use of
vendor-provided message-passing interfaces.

In the receive code, there are routines to extract the data from short
and long messages (MPID_extract_short, MPID_extract_long).  In addition,
nonblocking versions of the long message version (MPID_nextract_long,
MPID_wextract_long) are also available.

In the send code, the routines are MPID_post_send_short and
MPID_post_send_long.  MPID_post_send_long may use nonblocking operations.
