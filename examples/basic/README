This directory contains a few simple example programs and a Makefile that
you can copy for your own application programs.  These programs are among the
simplest that are distributed with mpich.  The Makefile is configured for
a particular environment from Makefile.in by the configure command in the
top-level mpich directory.

cpi     - calculates the value of pi using numerical integration, in C

fpi     - basically the same program in fortran

cpilog  - cpi with explicit logging, requires mpe library

systest - simple bandwidth benchmark

To make these, type 

  make

To run any one of them, use

  mpirun -np <number of processes> <program name>

There is a symbolic link to mpirun in this directory.  Problems to
mpi-bugs@mcs.anl.gov.
