1, Before using Jumpshot-3, you need to know where the SLOG file is.
   typically they have the file extention, slog.  The SLOG file 
   can be generated by programs like AIX(UTE)'s slogmerge, MPICH(MPE)'s
   clog2slog or MPICH(MPE)'s direct logging mechanism.  For AIX users,
   if one would like to view the statistics of the job, one also need 
   a statistics file which is usually generated by "utestat".  For 
   further details, read ibm_doc/ute.man on how to generate the SLOG 
   and statistics files in UTE environment.

2, To use Jumpshot-3, one needs to install the jumpshot-3 first.
   Building Jumpshot-3 includes building four jar files and two
   wrapper scripts.  This can be achieved simply by doing the following:

        cd $(JUMPSHOT-3)
        ./configure --with-java=<Your_JAVA_full_pathname>
        make

   Where "--with-java=<Your_JAVA_full_pathname>" is optional.  It is necessary
   only when configure cannot find a good version of Java in the typical
   java location.  The procedure listed above is for the case when the 
   source and installed files are put in the same directory.  The more 
   elaborated procedure is to do a VPATH build like the following:

       cd $(build_dir)
       ./configure --with-java=<Your_JAVA_full_pathname> --prefix=<install_dir>
       make
       make install

Or     

       cd $(build_dir)
       ./configure --with-java=<Your_JAVA_full_pathname>
       make
       make install PREFIX=<install_dir>

   For further details of configure, do "./configure --help"
   After "make install", "make uninstall" will remove all installed files.
        
Note: ignore the warning messages during compilation of jumpshot.jar if
      there is any( the existence of warning message could depend on the
      version of JDK that are being used ).

In AIX, be sure that the command "java -fullversion" returns a build date 
later than or equal to "JDK 1.1.6 IBM build a116-19990115 (JIT enabled: jitc)"

3, There are 2 ways to run jumpshot.

   a, using the supplied script in $(JUMPSHOT-3)/bin:
      If you have followed the instruction to build the jar files and scripts,
      assume you are at $(JUMPSHOT-3)/ and you can run Jumpshot-3 by
      entering "bin/jumpshot logfiles/slog_filename", e.g.

      /homes/chan/jumpshot-3> bin/jumpshot ../logfiles/merge.slog

   b, run jumpshot directly using "java"
      Set the CLASSPATH in your local shell to where slog.jar, preview.jar,
      statsviewer.jar, jumpshot.jar and images.jar are located.  And 
      you can invoke the jumpshot as "java jumpshot slog_filename".

   For further details, Read $(JUMPSHOT-3)/README.slog

4, When Jumsphot-3 is running, you will first see a small window
   titled "Jumpshot".   A brief manuel about the functionality
   of most buttons can be found by clicking the Help menu tab then
   Manuel button.  An ASCII version is at $(JUMPSHOT-3)/doc/jumpshot.def 
   If you want to know what jumpshot-3 can do, click the Help menu
   tab then Tour button, or read $(JUMPSHOT-3)/doc/TourStepByStep.pdf

5, One can have several Time Lines windows displayed simultaneously
   as long as the JVM has enough memory.  This feature allows one
   to compare the different frames with identical views or identical
   frame with different views.

6, For further details of code, read the READMEs in the directories
   $(SLOG_API), $(SLOG_API)/src, $(JUMPSHOT-3), $(JUMPSHOT-3)/src, 
   $(JUMPSHOT-3)/src/GraphicPreview and $(JUMPSHOT-3)/src/main.
