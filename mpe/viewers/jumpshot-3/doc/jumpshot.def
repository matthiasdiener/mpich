Jumpshot --- Graphical Visualization Tool for SLOG files
========================================================

***************
Jumpshot Window
***************
The first main window shows up when "jumpshot" is executed

In the top window menu bar, there are 4 pull-down menus.  They
are FILE, DISPLAY, SYSTEM and HELP menus.

FILE

                      to view.
    Exit            - Quit Jumpshot

DISPLAY
    Select type of display jumpshot should show.
    Only the Time Lines display is usable.  Mountain display has been disabled.

SYSTEM  
    - Select look and feel of choice. Certain look and feel may not be
      supported by the JVM that you are using.  
    - Enable or disable tool tips. Tool tips are small descriptions that
      become visible when user places mouse over some region like a button,
      window, etc.

HELP
    Manual          - Opens a viewer containing this document
    Tour            - Opens a HTML viewer containing "A Tour of Jumpshot-3"

Also there are LOGFILE panel and Read button.

LOGFILE 
    Contains name of loaded logfile

READ

****************************
View & Frame Selector Window
****************************
After the READ button in the Jumpshot window has been pressed, the window
titled "View & Frame Selector" and its corresponding "legend" dialog box
will show up.

In this window, you have a Graphical Frame Preview Selector which has
two pull-down menus, FILE and GRAPH.  The Graphical Preview contains
a simple graph of event count versus the duration of the whole logfile.

Read the description of various options in GUI/src/GraphicPreview/README

File:
    View Statistics - Invoke the UTE statistics viewer which can be used
                      to view statistical text file generated by UTE traces.
                      Read the ~/ibm_doc/README.viewstat for further detail.
    Close           - Close the View & Frame Window

Graph:
    Type  - display type of the Graphical Preview
        Bar   - ( default ), cummulative histograms
        Line  - curves

    Rescale - rescaling of Y-axis
        On    - automatic rescaling of y-axis
        Off   - retains the current scale of the y-axis

Data Sets:
    All     - display all data sets
    None    - clears all data sets in the graph

Zoom:
    In      - magnify the view around selected view point
    Out     - demagnify the view around selected view point
    Reset   - reset the magnification to the orginal scale

Legend:
    Display - display the legend for each data set.
    Hide    - hide the Legend dialog box


In the Graphical Preview, there is a Red Line which marks the __middle__ of
the frame to be displayed and also marks the view point to be used as
a reference point during zoom in and out.

Connectivity and View Options:
    In this window, there are 2 sets of radio buttons to define the properties
    of the frame to be displayed.  One is titled as "Connectivity Options"
    which allows "Disconnected States" or "Connected States" to be shown, 
    and the other one is titled as "View Options" which currently allows three 
    different views  ---  MPI-Process View, Thread View and Processor View.

    MPI-Process View : ( MPI rank ID : 0 ) is used as Y axis label in the
                       displayed frame later, where the 2nd integer is 
                       always zero.

    Thread View      : ( MPI rank ID : Local Thread ID ) is used as the Y axis 
                       label in the displayed frame. 

    Processor View   : ( Node ID : Local CPU ID ) is used as the Y axis label
                       in the displayed frame. 

    Note:  Not all combinations of "Connectivity Options" and "View Options",
           When "Processor View" is selected, only "Disconnected States" is 
           allowed.

Frame Infomation & Operations:
    Below these, there are buttons and textfield that allow user to manuelly
    select frame to display.  It is particularly important when the number
    of the pixels in the Graphical Preview is less than the number of
    frames available in the logfile.  In this case, the frame buttons are used
    to fine tune the frame of logfile that user wishes to view.

    - The PREVIOUS frame button decrements the frame index.
    - The DISPLAY  frame button display the selected frame.
    - The NEXT     frame button increments the frame index.

    Note: The only way to display a frame is to click on the DISPLAY button.
          Then a Time Line Window with the properties selected will pop up.

    Also the textfield next to "Current frame =" under the Frame Information
    panel allows one to directly type in a frame index to view.  The Red
    Line Marker in the Graphical Preview and the Frame Buttons will be updated
    according.  The frame index should be between 0 and (Number of frames - 1 ).

Zoom Operations:
---------------
IN, OUT          - These buttons are used to zoom in and out horizontally
                   Zooming out of the frame __before__ zooming in will
                   produce unreasonable result.

RESET            - Reset the time range of the displayed frame to the 
                   default range.

Miscellaneous Operations:
------------------------
PRINT            - Clicking on this button will bring up the 'Print Dialog'

SCROLL BAR       - Use to move forward or backward in time.
                   Usually, one scrolls by dragging the scroll bar by

                   difference. To change value edit and press enter.
                   DO OPTIMAL NESTING: Calculates most appropriate nest factor
                   and implements it.

******************************
Time Lines Manipulation Window
******************************

This window contains options used to manipulate time lines.

SCROLLBAR        - This scrollbar is used to move selected time line forward or
                   backward in time. 

RESET            - This causes the process to take up its original position in
                   time.

VISIBLE          - This checkbox controls display status of selected time line.
                   A time line can be selected from 'AVAILABLE' list.

SWAP             - This causes selected time line to be swapped with current 
                   time line.

DELETE           - Selected time line is deleted. Deleted time line is removed
                   from 'AVAILABLE' list and placed in 'DELETED' list.

RESTORE          - Causes selected time line from 'DELETED' list to be placed 
                   just above selected time line from 'AVAILABLE' list.


******************
Definitions Window
******************

Below Time Line Window, it is a detachable window of the definitions of
all states and arrows.  It is labeled as the "legends for the Time Line
window".  This window can be torned out and re-attached to any of the 4 
sides of Time Line Window Window.  It can also be torn away from the Time 
Line Window and made to form its standalone window.

[State]          - Clicking on button for any state will show histogram
                   window for that state. 

checkbox         - Use this to enable/disable the state's visibility status.

**********************
state histogram Window
**********************

This window contains information on associated state. The histogram
given is the plot of number of state instances (y-axis) versus duration in 
seconds (x-axis).

***************
GUI Limitations
***************

1. If Definitions Window is torn away from Time Line Window to form its own
   window, the window will not close on its own when the Time Lines window is 
   closed.  To close it, user needs to click on the close icon provided
   by the window manager on the border of the window.
