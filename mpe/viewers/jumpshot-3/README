After "configure", do a "make" to create all the necessary jar files.

Or     cd $(build_dir)
       ./configure --with-java=<your java location>
       make
       make install PREFIX=<install_dir>

For further details of configure, do "./configure --help"

After "make install", "make uninstall" will remove all installed files.
