This directory contains useful routines that are not part of MPI but that
may be useful in writing and evaluating the performance of parallel programs.
They include (so far)

  timing routines
  logging routines
  real-time graphics routines
  parallel I/O routines


The command 'configure' may be used to create the Makefiles needed

Useful configure commands are:

   Cray T3D with native MPI
   configure -cc="/mpp/bin/cc -Tcray-t3d" -nof77

   SGI Power Challenge with native MPI
   configure -cc=cc -nof77
