Run mpi programs 
<H2>Description</H2>
"mpirun" is a shell script that attempts to hide the differences in
starting jobs for various devices from the user. Mpirun attempts to
determine what kind of machine it is running on and start the required
number of jobs on that machine. On workstation clusters, if you are
not using Chameleon, you must supply a file that lists the different
machines that mpirun can use to run remote jobs or specify this file
every time you run mpirun with the -machine file option. The default
file is in util/machines/machines.&lt;arch&gt;.
<P>
mpirun typically works like this
<PRE>
 mpirun -np &lt;number of processes&gt; &lt;program name and arguments&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
If mpirun cannot determine what kind of machine you are on, and it
is supported by the mpi implementation, you can the -machine
and -arch options to tell it what kind of machine you are running
on. The current valid values for machine are

	             without using a procgroup file. This script
                     currently does not work well with interactive
    	             jobs)

You should only have to specify mr_arch if mpirun does not recognize
your machine, the default value is wrong, or you are using the p4 or
execer devices.  The full list of options is

MPI_P4SSPORT are set, then that has the effect of giving
mpirun the -p4ssport 0 parameters.

On exit, mpirun returns a status of zero unless mpirun detected a problem, in
which case it returns a non-zero status (currently, all are one, but this
may change in the future).
<P>
<H2>Specifying Heterogeneous Systems</H2>
<P>
Multiple architectures may be handled by giving multiple <TT>-arch</TT> and <TT>-np
</TT>arguments.  For example, to run a program on 2 sun4s and 3 rs6000s, with
the local machine being a sun4, use
<PRE>
    mpirun -arch sun4 -np 2 -arch rs6000 -np 3 program
</PRE>

This assumes that program will run on both architectures.  If different
executables are needed (as in this case), the string <TT>%a</TT> will be replaced
with the arch name. For example, if the programs are <TT>program.sun4</TT> and
<TT>program.rs6000</TT>, then the command is
<PRE>
    mpirun -arch sun4 -np 2 -arch rs6000 -np 3 program.%a
</PRE>

If instead the execuables are in different directories; for example,
<TT>/tmp/me/sun4</TT> and <TT>/tmp/me/rs6000</TT>, then the command is
<PRE>
    mpirun -arch sun4 -np 2 -arch rs6000 -np 3 /tmp/me/%a/program
</PRE>

It is important to specify the architecture with <TT>-arch</TT> <EM>before</EM> specifying
the number of processors.  Also, the <EM>first</EM> <TT>-arch</TT> command must refer to the
processor on which the job will be started.  Specifically, if <TT>-nolocal</TT> is
<EM>not</EM> specified, then the first -arch must refer to the processor from which
mpirun is running.
<P>
(You must have <TT>machines.&lt;arch&gt;</TT> files for each arch that you use in the
<TT>util/machines</TT> directory.)
<P>
Another approach that may be used the the <TT>ch_p4</TT> device is to create a
<TT>procgroup</TT> file directly.  See the MPICH Users Guide for more information.
