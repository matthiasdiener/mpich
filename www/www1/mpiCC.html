Compiles and links MPI programs written in C++ 
<H2>Description</H2>
This command can be used to compile and link MPI programs written in
C++.  It provides the options and any special libraries that are
needed to compile and link MPI programs.
<P>
It is important to use this command (or a <TT>Makefile</TT> processed with
<TT>mpireconfig</TT>) particularly when linking programs, as it provides
the necessary libraries.  It can also simplify the use of the MPE
profiling libraries, through the use of the <TT>-mpilog</TT>, <TT>-mpitrace</TT>,
and <TT>-mpianim</TT> commands.
<P>
mpiCC cannot be used to compile C programs.  Use mpicc for C programs.

<H2>Command line arguments</H2>
<DL><DT><B>-mpilog    </B> <DD> Build version that generate MPE log files
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>-mpitrace  </B> <DD> Build version that generates traces
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>-mpianim   </B> <DD> Build version that generates real-time
animation
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>-show      </B> <DD> Show the commands that would be used without
runnning them
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>-help      </B> <DD> Give short help
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>-echo      </B> <DD> Show exactly what this program is doing.
This option should normally not be used.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>others     </B> <DD> are passed to the compiler or linker.  For example, <TT>-c</TT>
causes files to be compiled, <TT>-g</TT> selects compilation with debugging
on most systems, and <TT>-o name</TT> causes linking with the output
executable given the name <TT>name</TT>.
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Environment Variables</H2>
The environment variables <TT>MPICH_CCC</TT> and <TT>MPICH_CCLINKER</TT> may be used
to select different C++ compiler and linker.  Note that since
MPICH is built with a particular C++ and C compiler, change the
compilers used can cause problems.  Use this only if you could intermix
code compiled with the different compilers.
<P>
<H2>Examples</H2>
To compile a single file <TT>foo.c</TT>, use
<PRE>
   mpicc -c foo.c 
</PRE>

<P>
To link the output and make an executable, use
<PRE>
   mpicc -o foo foo.o
</PRE>

Combining compilation and linking in a single command
<PRE>
   mpicc -o foo foo.c
</PRE>

is a convenient way to build simple programs.
