MultiProcessing Environment 
<H2>Description</H2>
The main benefit the MultiProcessing Environment library, <TT>mpe</TT>, offers is a
set of routines that will create logfiles from MPI programs which can be
examined by <TT>jumpshot</TT> or <TT>upshot.</TT>  These logfiles can be created manually by
inserting calls to <TT>mpe</TT> routines in your code, automatically by linking
with the appropriate MPE libraries, or by combining the two methods.
Currently, the <TT>mpe</TT> library offers 3 profiling libraries.

and partner (destination for sends, source for receives).  Output 
is to standard output.

<H2>Configuring the MPE library</H2>
The <TT>mpe</TT> library can be configured and installed as an extension of your
current MPI implementation, or automatically during MPICH's configure and make
process.  The only requirement is that you configure with a specific MPI
implementation switch.  Currently, we have configured the <TT>mpe</TT> library to
work with MPICH, SGI's MPI, IBM's MPI, and CRAY's MPI (not thoroughly
tested).  There are 3 types of configure options or switches.

<H2>Example MPE Programs</H2>
As previously noted, the <TT>mpe</TT> library is composed of 3 different profiling
libraries.  Each MPI implementation requires a slightly different way in which
to link with these libraries.  During configure, the link path and appropriate
libraries are determined and assigned to variables.  These variables are
substituted in the Makefile in the <TT>mpe/contrib/test</TT> directory.  The
following is a list of these variables.
<P>
<BR>LOG_LIB   =  link path needed to link with the logging library
<P>
<BR>TRACE_LIB =  link path needed to link with the tracing library
<P>
<BR>ANIM_LIB  =  link path needed to link with the animation library
<P>
In the  <TT>mpe/test</TT> directory there is a variable FLIB_PATH which is the link
path needed to link fortran programs with the logging library.
<P>
During make, a small C program <TT>cpi</TT> (in the <TT>mpe/contrib/test</TT> directory) will
be linked with each of the above libraries.  In the output from Make, a
message will be written regarding the success of each attempted link test.
Also, in the <TT>mpe/test</TT> directory a small Fortran program <TT>fpi</TT> will be linked
with logging library using FLIB_PATH.  The success of this link test will also
be included in the Make output.  If the link tests were successful, then these
library paths should be used for your programs as well.

<H2>Additional Information</H2>
To view a list of configure options, type <TT>./configure --help</TT> in the
top-level <TT>mpe</TT> directory.
<P>
In the Installation Manual, there is a section on MPE which gives
instructions and examples for each type of installation.
<P>
The README in the top-level <TT>mpe</TT> directory.
<P>
In the Users Guide, there is additional information describing the MPE
routines and the profiling libraries.
<P>
The man pages included in the distribution has information regarding the MPE
routines.  The command <TT>mpich/bin/mpiman</TT> is a script that runs <TT>xman</TT> on
these man pages.
