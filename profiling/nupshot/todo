	I hope a new feature can be added to nupshot.

	I wish to selectively diable the display of some 
	states from nupshot. This will be of great help when
	there are a huge no of states (as in petsc).

It would be nice if upshot could assign colors 
automatically to states.
(I don't want to call MPE_Describe_state(10, 11,"XYZ",0)
						      ^^

Also it would be nice if event nnumbers in libraries do not 
overlap. For eg: the event nos used in -lmpi start from 1
and a mpiuser (who might add his own events might unknowingly
start from 1) For petsc, i plan to use event nos starting from 1000,
hoping it dosn't clash with other profiling libs.
