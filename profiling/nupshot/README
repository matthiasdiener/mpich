Nupshot - early version of new, faster Upshot

The upshot in ../upshot is all written in Tcl.  Tcl is an interpreted,
string-based language, and is not very fast with number crunching.
Thus, that version of Upshot is pretty pokey.  Upshot is being mostly
rewritten in C, so everything is much faster.  It is mostly done, but
it is still missing the display of messages, and can only load alog-format
logfiles.  Feature suggestions (that are not already in the all-Tcl
version of Upshot) are welcome, as are bug reports, of course.

Be sure to specify -tcldir and -tkdir when running mpich/configure.
Otherwise, the Nupshot compilation will fail.
