Nupshot - preliminary version of new, faster Upshot

The upshot in ../upshot is all written in Tcl.  Tcl is an interpreted,
string-based language, and is thus not very fast with number crunching.
Thus, that version of Upshot is pretty pokey.  Upshot is being mostly
rewritten in C, so everything is much faster.  It is at a useable point
in the development, so we thought we'd let some other people try it
out.  It doesn't have much; no legend, no printing, to process numbers,
alog-format logfiles only, but it will.  Feature suggestions (that are
not already in the all-Tcl version of Upshot) are welcome, as are bug
reports, of course.

Be sure to specify -tcldir and -tkdir when running mpich/configure.
Otherwise, the Nupshot compilation will fail.
