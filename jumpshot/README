Jumpshot - Graphical visualization Tool
======================================

This distribution contains the source code and class files (byte code)
for Jumpshot. Jumpshot is a Graphical visualization Tool written using 
Java Version 1.1 JDK. It is used to study binary logfiles of 'clog' 
format.

Obtaining and installing Jumpshot
---------------------------------
Unix
----
1. Make sure that you have JDK 1.1.2 or higher installed on your machine. If you do
   not have it, it could be downloaded from 
        http://java.sun.com
        
2. Make sure to include java in your path. Add the absolute path of the "jdk1.1.2/bin"
   directory to your Unix path variable, as follows.  

   The path variable enables Solaris to find the executables (javac, java, javadoc, etc.) 
   from any current directory.

   If using C Shell you could include the following line in your .cshrc

   set path=([directory where JDK is installed]/jdk1.1.2/bin $path)

   Note:In some machines particualrly SGIs the java directory may be called "java" instead
   of "jdk1.1.2". In that case simply change the name.

   set path=([directory where JDK is installed]/java/bin $path)

3. Make sure that you have a CLASSPATH variable having java classes. You can do 
   this by 

   Solaris:
      setenv CLASSPATH [directory where JDK is installed]/jdk1.1.2/lib/classes.zip
 
   Irix:
      setenv CLASSPATH [directroy where JDK is installed]/java/classes

   The two lines are attempting to do the same thing. However, on SGI's the classes
   seem to be not zipped and also in a different place. In solaris apparently 
   java can read from a zipped file classes.zip.

4. Also include in the above CLASSPATH variable the path where Jumpshot classes 
   are going to reside. This can be done
        
   setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:[directory where Jumpshot will be installed]/jumpshot-1.0:
   [directory where Jumpshot will be installed]/jumpshot-1.0/jumpshot   
      
   jumpshot-1.0 is the directory that will be created when you install the distribution.

5. Jumpshot can be obtained through anonymous ftp from ............... ftp the tar 
   file jumpshot-1.0.tar.gz. 

6. Copy this file in the directory where you want to install Jumpshot.

7. Unzip it using 
        gunzip jumpshot-1.0.tar.gz

8. Untar the unzipped file jumpshot-1.0.tar using 
        tar -xvf jumpshot-1.0.tar

9. This will create a directory jumpshot-1.0. In this directory you will find this
   README file, a directory jumpshot which contains the source code and byte code
   for the entire Jumpshot program, a directory containing sample logfiles and a directory
   data that contains certain configuration files for Jumpshot like Jumpshot.setup, 
   Jumpshot.help and Jumpshot.colors.

                            jumpshot-1.0
                               |
    ___________________________|____________________________________
   |           |                              |                     |
   README     data                          logfiles              jumpshot
            (Jumpshot.help, etc.)     (arrowtest.clog, etc)      (Source code (*.java)
                                                                  and Byte code (*.class)

10. Now you can run Jumpshot from anywhere by typing java jumpshot.Jumpshot

Windows
-------

The direction for windows are similar to Solaris except the commands in the Shell script and
obtain jumpshot-1.0.zip file instead of jumpshot1.0-tar.gz

1.Add the absolute path of the "jdk1.1.2\bin" directory to your PATH statement as follows. 

     The PATH statement enables Windows to find the executables 
     (javac, java, javadoc, etc.) from any current directory.

     To find out the current value of your PATH, at the
     DOS prompt type:

         C:\> path

     To change the PATH, open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and make the
     change to the PATH statement. To edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file in Windows 95: 

       i. Start a text editor by choosing "Start", "Programs", 
          "Accessories", and choosing WordPad or NotePad. 
      ii. Choose Open from the File menu and type "c:\autoexec.bat" 
          for the filename This will open the file for editing. 
     iii. Look for the PATH statement. Notice that the PATH statement
          is a series of directories separated by semi-colons (;).  
          Windows looks for programs in the PATH directories in order,
          from left to right. Look for other JDK versions in the PATH.
          There should only be one path to a classes.zip file.
          When in doubt, put the java directory at the end of 
          the path statement. For example, in the following PATH
          statement, we have added the java directory at the end: 

           PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;C:\;C:\DOS;
           [drive]:[directory where JDK is installed]\JDK1.1.2\BIN 

     To make the path take effect, execute the following:

           C:\> autoexec.bat

2. Add the java classes to your CLASSPATH variable. This can be done by typing
   the following in the DOS-Shell.

   set CLASSPATH=[drive]:\[directory where Jumpshot is installed]\jumpshot-1.0;
   [drive]:\[directory where Jumpshot is installed]\jumpshot-1.0\jumpshot;
   [drive]:\[directory where JDK is installed]\jdk1.1.2\lib\classes.zip

   Now you can run Jumpshot from anywhere by typing java Jumpshot. 
 
   If you close this shell then these changes will be lost and you will have to do 
   step 2. again. As of now I do not know of a way in which the CLASSPATH can be set 
   permanently.
